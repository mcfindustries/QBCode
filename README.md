Quickbase is preventing the use of Javascript in your applications.  For detailed information loo at this article

The solution is to use a Code Page for all the tricks, tips and UX issues that your application needs.   The repository here has sample Code Pages and corresponding Rich Text fields to call and execute them.


Any file with the .quickbase extension is for inserting into your application in a Formula Rich Text Field.  I suggest you use Visual Studio Code and then get the Quickbase extension for editing and saving those in your own Repositiory to keep your Quickbase application logic in Source Control.
